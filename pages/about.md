My name is Megan Rodgers and I am currently studying at Kent State University for Fashion Design and have a bachelor’s degree in Fashion Merchandising. I was chosen as one of the top 20 students in my Junior class to submit for CFDA and Joes Black Book.

With my education and experience, I would be an asset to your company in the Assistant Designer position. As a Design Assistant at Ellery Homestyles, I was described as having an “insane work ethic.” I demonstrated that I had an eye for color and design and could be trusted to get the job done.

* Showcased in "Wearing Justice" exhibit at Kent State Museum for the 50th anniversary of the May 4th shooting.
