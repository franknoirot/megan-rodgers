# MeganRodgers.me

A small portfolio site for Megan Rodgers, a fashion designer who recently earned her MFA from Kent State University.

## Key Features
- Simple, flat-file content management using NetlifyCMS
- Wicked fast, SEO-friendly pages using Gridsome
- Robust custom image carousel component
- Cute little bee companion üêù

## TO-DOs
- Get live previews within NetlifyCMS (don't believe there is support for Vue, seems silly to write the page preview in React when the site's in Vue, alas)
- Automatic image resizing/compressing (might not be worth it, as I don't want the source files to be large either to save my GitHub account.)
