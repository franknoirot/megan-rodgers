Menswear collection inspired by my trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand and visiting the Black House and White Temple. The Black House was designed by the artist Thawan Duchanee, whose dark, animalistic artwork and aesthetic was throughout the surreal collection of buildings. My graphics were inspired by his artwork, animal skins and architecture throughout Black House.
