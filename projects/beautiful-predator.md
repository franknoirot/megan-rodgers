Womenswear collections inspired by the orchid mantis, mantids that use orchid camouflage to ambush prey. Their disguise is so effective that flying insects are more attracted to the mantis than the flowers they6 imitate. It inspired me to make a collection that plays with this beautiful predatorâ€™s ability to disguise itself and attract its prey. I used pleats and gathers to imitate the shapes of the orchid mantis body and cochineal natural dyes to ombre pieces to mimic the pink color of the mantis.
