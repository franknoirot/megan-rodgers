Womenswear collection inspired by the Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Art. O’Keefe was an accomplished seamstress as well as a talented artist. I was inspired by the detailing of her personally designed pieces and the androgynous aesthetic of her personal style. O’Keefe loved challenging and confounding society’s conventional dress codes.
