<p>Womenswear collection inspired by the Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern
exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Art. O’Keefe was an accomplished
seamstress as well as a talented artist. I was inspired by the detailing of her
personally designed pieces and the androgynous aesthetic of her personal style.
O’Keefe loved challenging and confounding society’s conventional dress codes.</p>
