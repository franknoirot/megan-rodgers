<p>When asked to create a womenswear collection based on diversity, I found
inspiration in the lack of diversity in monocropping that is the one of the main
causes of rainforest destruction. I was inspired by the manmade patterns of
corn/soy fields, farm land and rice fields from my trip to Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>These manmade patterns disrupting diversity represented by leaves and plant life
inspired my print design. I hand painted and printed with natural dyes to create
my prints and patterns on hemp fabric. One of my pieces from this collection won
“Best Use of Inspiration” at the <a href="https://cbgarden.org/orchid-mania/orchid-show/">Cleveland Botanical Garden</a> Orchid Show.</p>
