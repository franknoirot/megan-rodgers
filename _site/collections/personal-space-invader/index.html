<p>Womenswear collection inspired by public transportation and my
years taking the subway in New York City. I was inspired by how we interact
with people in these intimate proximities but still place significant distance
between ourselves and strangers. Prints and graphics were inspired by crowds,
need for personal space and subway staples such as rats.</p>
