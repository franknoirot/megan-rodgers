<h1>MeganRodgers.me</h1>
<p>A small portfolio site for Megan Rodgers, a fashion designer earning her MFA from Kent State University.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simple, flat-file content management using NetlifyCMS</li>
<li>Wicked fast, SEO-friendly pages using Gridsome</li>
<li>Robust custom image carousel component</li>
<li>Cute little bee companion üêù</li>
</ul>
<h2>TO-DOs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get live previews within NetlifyCMS (don't believe there is support for Vue, seems silly to write the page preview in React when the site's in Vue, alas)</li>
<li>Automatic image resizing/compressing (might not be worth it, as I don't want the source files to be large either to save my GitHub account.)</li>
</ul>
