<p>My name is Megan Rodgers and I have recently graduated from Kent State University for Fashion Design and have a bachelor’s degree in Fashion Merchandising. I was chosen as one of the top 30 students in my Senior class to participate in the Portfolio Showcase.</p>
<p>With my education and experience, I would be an asset to your company in the Assistant Designer position. As a Design Assistant at Ellery Homestyles, I was described as having an “insane work ethic.” I demonstrated that I had an eye for color and design and could be trusted to get the job done.</p>
