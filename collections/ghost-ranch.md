Womenswear collection inspired by the Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern
 exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Art. O’Keefe was an accomplished
 seamstress as well as a talented artist. I was inspired by the detailing of her
 personally designed pieces and the androgynous aesthetic of her personal style.
 O’Keefe loved challenging and confounding society’s conventional dress codes.
