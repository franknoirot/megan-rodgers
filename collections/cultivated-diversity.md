When asked to create a womenswear collection based on diversity, I found
 inspiration in the lack of diversity in monocropping that is the one of the main
 causes of rainforest destruction. I was inspired by the manmade patterns of
 corn/soy fields, farm land and rice fields from my trip to Thailand and Vietnam.

These manmade patterns disrupting diversity represented by leaves and plant life
 inspired my print design. I hand painted and printed with natural dyes to create
 my prints and patterns on hemp fabric. One of my pieces from this collection won
 “Best Use of Inspiration” at the [Cleveland Botanical Garden](https://cbgarden.org/orchid-mania/orchid-show/) Orchid Show.
